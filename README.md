RepRapPro slicing profiles
========

Official RepRapPro profiles for Duet based machines for slicing your 3D model STL files into GCode.

Here are Slic3r config bundles to use with Slic3r 1.2.5  and above binaries. You can get these from http://slic3r.org/download and follow the installation instructions you will find there. Once installed click File, load config bundle and choose the file appropriate to your machine.

If you have an older, Melzi based machine, profiles for your machine may be downloaded from the link under the "Tags" section linked at the top of this page.
