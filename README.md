RepRapPro slicing profiles
========

Official RepRapPro profiles for Duet based machines for slicing your 3D model STL files into GCode. 

These config bundles are to be used with Slic3r 1.1.7 (and later). Get the latest version of Slic3r from http://slic3r.org/download and follow the installation instructions. 

To install our config bundle for Slic3r, download the whole repository by clicking on the 'Download ZIP' button on the right of the main page of this repository, then decompress the ZIP file. Open Slic3r, click 'File > load config bundle' and choose the .ini file appropriate to your machine.

If you want to download just the .ini file for your machine from this repository, **DO NOT right click and download the file from the first page!** While you will get a file that is called '[machine name].ini', it will be an html file, not the settings file, and will not import into Slic3r. To get the correct version of file, click on the link on the first page of this repository, then download the 'RAW' version of the file.

If you have an older, Melzi based machine, profiles for your machine may be downloaded from the link under the "Tags" section linked at the top of this page.
